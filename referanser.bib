               matter of concern for the physician and the child's family.
               Prior to a comprehensive otological, neurological, and
               vestibular clinical examination, physicians often request CT or
               MRI scanning, although in most cases such expensive testing is
               unnecessary. The present work is based on the results of a
               14-year study conducted with a sample of more than 2,000
               children referred for vertigo and balance disorders to the
               functional vestibular evaluation unit of the ENT pediatric
               department at Robert Debre Hospital (Paris). The clinical signs

               experience on the posterior cranial fossa tumors in young adults
               during the past 15 years. METHODS: From 1991 to 2005, 16 (0.8\%)
               of 2,091 young adults (range, 16-29 years) with
               dizziness/vertigo, hearing loss, or tinnitus were diagnosed with
               posterior fossa tumor. Each patient underwent a battery of
               audiovestibular tests and image study. RESULTS: Audiometry
               revealed sensorineural hearing loss in 12 patients (75\%).
               Spontaneous nystagmus was disclosed in eight patients (50\%),
               consisting of bilateral gaze nystagmus in five, unilateral gaze
               nystagmus in two, and downbeat nystagmus in one.
               Electronystagmographic examination displayed abnormal eye
               tracking test in 75\% and abnormal optokinetic nystagmus test in
               81\% of cases. Magnetic resonance imaging scan demonstrated
               space-occupying lesions at the cerebellopontine angle in 11,
               cerebellum in two, brainstem in two, and jugular fossa in one.
               Diagnoses consisted of vestibular schwannoma and
               neurofibromatosis II in eight patients (50\%), glial neoplasm
               (including astrocytoma, ependymoma, glioma) in four patients
               (25\%), epidermoid cyst in three patients, and glomus jugulare
               tumor in one patient. At study close, excluding one lost
               patient, three patients died as a result of recurrent or
               residual tumor at the primary site. Restated, 12 of 15 (80\%)
               patients were alive. CONCLUSIONS: Unlike predominant
               medulloblastoma in children, the most frequent posterior fossa
               tumor in young adults is vestibular schwannoma and neurofibroma.
               However, the second most frequent one in young adults is glial
               neoplasm as opposed to meningioma in adults.",

               hypotension (OH) is diagnosed when a fall in systolic blood
               pressure of at least 20 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure of
               at least 10 mm Hg within 3 min of standing is recorded. The
               elements of orthostatic blood pressure drop that are relevant to
               the definition of OH include magnitude of the drop, time to
               reach the blood pressure difference defined as OH, and

               of these elements, there exist issues that argue for
               modification of the presently accepted criteria of OH.
               Additional questions need to be addressed. Should one standard

               should tests be tailored to the patients' clinical

@ARTICLE{Møller2001,
  title    = "Perilymphatic fistula",
  author   = "Møller, P and Molvær, O I and Lind, O",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Perilymphatic fistula is leakage of perilymph from
              the inner ear to the middle ear. The perilymph surrounds the
              endolymphatic system in the inner ear (cochlea and the vestibular
              apparatus) and is most likely a cerebrospinal fluid filtrate.
              Leakage can occur through the fenestra vestibuli (the oval
              window), the fenestra cochleae (the round window), or
              pathological openings in the otic capsule. The cause of
              perilymphatic fistula can be trauma (barotrauma, head trauma,
              whiplash injury, iatrogenic trauma during ear surgery or ear
              syringing), chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma, congenital
              malformations or idiopathic. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We present 15
              patients operated at Haukeland University Hospital from 1980 to
              1997. RESULTS: Symptoms and signs are not very consistent, but
              dizziness and hearing loss are usual. The fistula test has low
              sensitivity and specificity, and otomicroscopy is not diagnostic.
              Imaging techniques with CT and MRI are seldom helpful unless in
              cases of inner ear abnormalities. Surgical exploration of the
              middle ear can be diagnostic, but even then it may in some cases
              be difficult to determine if a perilymphatic fistula is present.
              INTERPRETATION: The treatment of suspected perilymphatic fistula
              is primarily bed rest with elevated head, and avoidance of
              straining to facilitate spontaneous closure of a possible
              fistula. If the symptoms continue, or get worse, surgical
              exploration is indicated. The results are good regarding
              dizziness, but more uncertain as far as hearing improvement is
              concerned. Hearing improvement seems to be negatively correlated
              with the length of the delay before the fistula is closed.",

  title     = "Temporal bone fractures: traditional classification and clinical
               relevance",
  author    = "Ishman, Stacey L and Friedland, David R",
  abstract  = "OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: The objectives were to evaluate the
               clinical relevance of traditional temporal bone radiographic
               descriptors and to investigate the efficacy of an alternative
               fracture classification scheme. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective
               consecutive case series. METHODS: Charts and computed tomography
               scans representing 155 temporal bone fractures at a level I
               trauma center were reviewed. Fracture types were correlated with
               clinical presentation and outcomes. RESULTS: The traditional
               classification system (i.e., longitudinal, transverse, or mixed)
               correlated poorly with clinical findings such as facial nerve
               weakness and cerebrospinal fluid leakage. It also had limited
               utility in predicting conductive hearing loss and sensorineural
               hearing. An alternative schema distinguishing petrous from
               nonpetrous involvement demonstrated better correlation with
               these measures. Cerebrospinal fluid leak was 1.1 times more
               common in transverse than in longitudinal fractures but was 9.8
               times more common in petrous than in nonpetrous fractures.
               Similarly, facial nerve injury more strongly correlated with
               fractures through the petrous temporal bone than did the other
               fracture types. Sensorineural hearing loss did not correlate
               with the transverse fracture classification but was
               significantly more prevalent in petrous fractures. Likewise,
               conductive hearing loss did not correlate with longitudinal
               fractures but was four times more common in the ``middle ear''
               subcategory of nonpetrous fractures. CONCLUSION: Traditional
               temporal bone fracture descriptions correlate poorly with
               clinical findings. However, simply distinguishing petrous from
               nonpetrous involvement demonstrates significant correlation with
               the occurrence of serious sequelae of temporal bone fractures.
               Subcategories of mastoid and middle ear involvement further

               vestibular migraine. Vestibular migraine was included in the
               appendix of the third edition of the International
               Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-3, 2013 and 2018) as

               procedures. Probable vestibular migraine may be included in a
               later version of the ICHD, when further evidence has
               accumulated. The diagnosis of vestibular migraine is based on
               recurrent vestibular symptoms, a history of migraine, a temporal
               association between vestibular symptoms and migraine symptoms
               and exclusion of other causes of vestibular symptoms. Symptoms

               diagnosis, which is typically made by MRI. In the majority of
               cases the tumour is small, leaving the clinician and patient
               with the options of either serial scanning or active treatment
               by gamma knife radiosurgery (GKR) or microneurosurgery. Despite
               the vast number of published treatment reports, comparative
               studies are few, and evidence is no better than class III (May,
               2006). The predominant clinical endpoints of VS treatment
               include tumour control, facial nerve function and hearing
               preservation. Less focus has been put on symptom relief and
               health-related quality of life (QOL). It is uncertain if

  author   = "Taylor, David Mcd and O'Toole, Kevin S and Ryan, Christopher M",
  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Scuba diving-specific injuries have been well
              described. However, the injury experiences of individual divers
              over long diving careers have rarely been investigated. Our
              objective was to study the acute and chronic injuries of
              experienced, recreational scuba divers. METHODS: This was an
              international, cross-sectional, descriptive postal survey of
              experienced, recreational scuba divers belonging to diving clubs
              in Australia and the United States. RESULTS: Seven hundred nine
              divers were enrolled (346 Australian divers and 363 US divers).
              Most participants were experienced (mean number of dives, 262)
              male divers (488; 68.8\%) aged 31 to 50 years (425; 59.9\%). Mild
              barotrauma was common. Ear, sinus, and tooth ``squeeze'' had been
              experienced on > or = 1 occasion by 369 (52.1\%), 245 (34.6\%),
              and 66 (9.2\%) divers, respectively. Tympanic membrane (TM)
              rupture, round/oval window rupture, and subcutaneous emphysema
              had been experienced by 38 (5.4\%), 8 (1.1\%), and 5 (0.7\%)
              divers, respectively. No diver reported pneumothorax or arterial
              gas embolism (AGE); however, 31 divers (4.4\%) had suffered
              decompression sickness (DCS). A wide range of other injuries were
              reported. Sixteen divers (2.3\%) reported permanent disabilities,
              which largely consisted of hearing loss, tinnitus, and balance
              disorder. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of experienced divers who
              responded to the survey had suffered diving-related injuries,
              mainly barotrauma. Further research and diver education are
              needed to better document injury rates and minimize serious
              diving-related injuries and permanent disabilities.",

               oscillatory perception (`rocking,' `bobbing,' or `swaying')
               present continuously or for most of the day; 2] Onset occurs

               Symptoms temporarily reduce with exposure to passive motion
               (e.g. driving), and 4] Symptoms persist for >48 hours. MdDS may
               be designated as ``in evolution,'' if symptoms are ongoing but
               the observation period has been less than 1 month;
               ``transient,'' if symptoms resolve at or before 1 month and the
               observation period extends at least to the resolution point; or
               ``persistent'' if symptoms last for more than 1 month.

               spatial disorientation, visual motion intolerance, fatigue, and

               postural perceptual dizziness (PPPD) are reviewed.
               Motion-moderated oscillatory vertigo can also occur without a
               motion trigger, typically following another vestibular disorder,
               a medical illness, heightened psychological stress, or metabolic
               disturbance. Terminology for this non-motion triggered
               presentation has been varied as it has features of both MdDS and
               PPPD. Further research is needed into its phenomenological and

               Unilateral Vestibulopathy (AUVP), a synonym for vestibular
               Vestibular Disorders of the B{\'a}r{\'a}ny Society. AUVP
               manifests as an acute vestibular syndrome due to an acute
               unilateral loss of peripheral vestibular function without
               evidence for acute central or acute audiological symptoms or
               signs. This implies that the diagnosis of AUVP is based on the
               patient history, bedside examination, and, if necessary,
               laboratory evaluation. The leading symptom is an acute or rarely
               subacute onset of spinning or non-spinning vertigo with
               unsteadiness, nausea/vomiting and/or oscillopsia. A leading
               clinical sign is a spontaneous peripheral vestibular nystagmus,
               which is direction-fixed and enhanced by removal of visual
               fixation with a trajectory appropriate to the semicircular canal
               afferents involved (generally horizontal-torsional). The
               diagnostic criteria were classified by the committee for four
               categories: 1. ``Acute Unilateral Vestibulopathy'', 2. ``Acute
               Unilateral Vestibulopathy in Evolution'', 3. ``Probable Acute
               Unilateral Vestibulopathy'' and 4. ``History of Acute Unilateral
               Vestibulopathy''. The specific diagnostic criteria for these are
               as follows:``Acute Unilateral Vestibulopathy'': A) Acute or
               subacute onset of sustained spinning or non-spinning vertigo
               (i.e., an acute vestibular syndrome) of moderate to severe
               intensity with symptoms lasting for at least 24 hours. B)
               Spontaneous peripheral vestibular nystagmus with a trajectory
               appropriate to the semicircular canal afferents involved,
               generally horizontal-torsional, direction-fixed, and enhanced by
               removal of visual fixation. C) Unambiguous evidence of reduced
               VOR function on the side opposite the direction of the fast
               phase of the spontaneous nystagmus. D) No evidence for acute
               central neurological, otological or audiological symptoms. E) No
               acute central neurological signs, namely no central ocular motor
               or central vestibular signs, in particular no pronounced skew
               deviation, no gaze-evoked nystagmus, and no acute audiologic or
               otological signs. F) Not better accounted for by another disease
               or disorder.``Acute Unilateral Vestibulopathy in Evolution'': A)
               Acute or subacute onset of sustained spinning or non-spinning
               vertigo with continuous symptoms for more than 3 hours, but not
               yet lasting for at least 24 h hours, when patient is seen; B) -
               F) as above. This category is useful for diagnostic reasons to
               differentiate from acute central vestibular syndromes, to
               initiate specific treatments, and for research to include
               patients in clinical studies.``Probable Acute Unilateral
               Vestibulopathy'': Identical to AUVP except that the unilateral
               VOR deficit is not clearly observed or documented.``History of
               acute unilateral vestibulopathy'': A) History of acute or
               subacute onset of vertigo lasting at least 24 hours and slowly
               decreasing in intensity. B) No history of simultaneous acute
               audiological or central neurological symptoms. C) Unambiguous
               evidence of unilaterally reduced VOR function. D) No history of
               simultaneous acute central neurological signs, namely no central
               ocular motor or central vestibular signs and no acute
               audiological or otological signs. E) Not better accounted for by
               another disease or disorder. This category allows a diagnosis in
               patients presenting with a unilateral peripheral vestibular
               deficit and a history of an acute vestibular syndrome who are

               there is no definite test for AUVP. Therefore, its diagnosis

               consensus paper will discuss other aspects of AUVP such as
               etiology, pathophysiology and laboratory examinations if they
               are directly relevant to the classification criteria.",

  abstract  = "Diagnosing dizziness can be challenging, and the consequences of
               missing dangerous causes, such as stroke, can be substantial.
               Most physicians use a diagnostic paradigm developed more than 40
               years ago that focuses on the type of dizziness, but this
               approach is flawed. This article proposes a new paradigm based
               on symptom timing, triggers, and targeted bedside eye
               examinations (TiTrATE). Patients fall into 1 of 4 major syndrome
               categories, each with its own differential diagnosis and set of
               targeted examination techniques that help make a specific
               diagnosis. Following an evidence-based approach could help
               reduce the frequency of misdiagnosis of serious causes of
               dizziness. In the spirit of the flipped classroom, the editors
               of this Neurologic Clinics issue on emergency neuro-otology have
               assembled a collection of unknown cases to be accessed
               electronically in multimedia format. By design, cases are not
               linked with specific articles, to avoid untoward cueing effects
               for the learner. The cases are real and are meant to demonstrate
               and reinforce lessons provided in this and subsequent articles.
               In addition to pertinent elements of medical history, cases

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: The impact of dizziness on quality of life is often
               assessed by the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI), which is
               used as a discriminate and evaluative measure. The aim of the
               present study was to examine reliability and validity of a
               translated Norwegian version (DHI-N), also examining
               responsiveness to important change in the construct being
               measured. METHODS: Two samples (n = 92 and n = 27) included
               participants with dizziness of mainly vestibular origin. A
               cross-sectional design was used to examine the factor structure
               (exploratory factor analysis), internal consistency (Cronbach's
               alpha), concurrent validity (Pearson's product moment
               correlation r), and discriminate ability (ROC curve analysis).
               Longitudinal designs were used to examine test-retest
               reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC)
               statistics, smallest detectable difference (SDD)), and
               responsiveness (Pearson's product moment correlation, ROC curve
               analysis; area under the ROC curve (AUC), and minimally
               important change (MIC)). The DHI scores range from 0 to 100.
               RESULTS: Factor analysis revealed a different factor structure
               than the original DHI, resulting in dismissal of subscale scores
               in the DHI-N. Acceptable internal consistency was found for the
               total scale (alpha = 0.95). Concurrent correlations between the
               DHI-N and other related measures were moderate to high, highest
               with Vertigo Symptom Scale-short form-Norwegian version (r =
               0.69), and lowest with preferred gait (r = - 0.36). The DHI-N
               demonstrated excellent ability to discriminate between
               participants with and without 'disability', AUC being 0.89 and
               best cut-off point = 29 points. Satisfactory test-retest
               reliability was demonstrated, and the change for an individual
               should be >/= 20 DHI-N points to exceed measurement error (SDD).
               Correlations between change scores of DHI-N and other
               self-report measures of functional health and symptoms were high
               (r = 0.50 - 0.57). Responsiveness of the DHI-N was excellent,
               AUC = 0.83, discriminating between self-perceived 'improved'
               versus 'unchanged' participants. The MIC was identified as 11
               DHI-N points. CONCLUSIONS: The DHI-N total scale demonstrated
               satisfactory measurement properties. This is the first study
               that has addressed and demonstrated responsiveness to important
               change of the DHI, and provided values of SDD and MIC to help
               interpret change scores.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to examine the psychometric
               properties of the Vertigo symptom scale - short form (VSS-SF), a
               condition-specific measure of dizziness, following translation
               of the scale into Norwegian. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey
               design was used to examine the factor structure, internal
               consistency and discriminative ability (sample I, n = 503). A
               cross-sectional pre-intervention design was used to examine the
               construct validity (sample II, n = 36) of the measure and a
               test-retest design was used to examine reliability (sub-sample
               of sample II, n = 28). RESULTS: The scree plot indicated a two
               factor structure accounting respectively for 41\% and 12\% of
               the variance prior to rotation. The factors were related to
               vertigo-balance (VSS-V) and autonomic-anxiety (VSS-A). Twelve of
               the items loaded clearly on either of the two dimensions, while
               three items cross-loaded. Internal consistency of the VSS-SF was
               high (alpha = 0.90). Construct validity was indicated by
               correlation between path length registered by platform
               posturography and the VSS-V (r = 0.52), but not with the VSS-A.
               The ability to discriminate between dizzy and not dizzy patients
               was excellent for the VSS-SF and sub-dimension VSS-V (area under
               the curve 0.87 and 0.91, respectively), and acceptable for the
               sub-dimension VSS-A (area under the curve 0.77). High
               test-retest reliability was demonstrated (ICC VSS-SF: 0.88,
               VSS-V: 0.90, VSS-A: 0.90) and no systematic change was observed
               in the scores from test to retest after 2 days. CONCLUSION:
               Using a Norwegian translated version of the VSS-SF, this is the
               first study to provide evidence of the construct validity of
               this instrument demonstrating a stable two factor structure of
               the scale, and the identified sub-dimensions of dizziness were
               related to vertigo-balance and autonomic-anxiety, respectively.
               Evidence regarding a physical construct underlying the
               vertigo-balance sub-scale was provided. Satisfactory internal
               consistency was indicated, and the discriminative ability of the
               instruments was demonstrated. The instrument showed satisfactory
               test-retest reliability.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: We aimed to validate two similar existing prognostic
               scores for early risk of stroke after transient ischaemic attack
               (TIA) and to derive and validate a unified score optimised for
               prediction of 2-day stroke risk to inform emergency management.
               METHODS: The California and ABCD scores were validated in four
               independent groups of patients (n=2893) diagnosed with TIA in
               emergency departments and clinics in defined populations in the
               USA and UK. Prognostic value was quantified with c statistics.
               The two groups used to derive the original scores (n=1916) were
               used to derive a new unified score based on logistic regression.
               FINDINGS: The two existing scores predicted the risk of stroke
               similarly in each of the four validation cohorts, for stroke
               risks at 2 days, 7 days, and 90 days (c statistics 0.60-0.81).
               In both derivation groups, c statistics were improved for a
               unified score based on five factors (age >or=60 years [1 point];
               blood pressure >or=140/90 mm Hg [1]; clinical features:
               unilateral weakness [2], speech impairment without weakness [1];
               duration >or=60 min [2] or 10-59 min [1]; and diabetes [1]).
               This score, ABCD(2), validated well (c statistics 0.62-0.83);
               overall, 1012 (21\%) of patients were classified as high risk
               (score 6-7, 8.1\% 2-day risk), 2169 (45\%) as moderate risk
               (score 4-5, 4.1\%), and 1628 (34\%) as low risk (score 0-3,
               1.0\%). IMPLICATIONS: Existing prognostic scores for stroke risk
               after TIA validate well on multiple independent cohorts, but the
               unified ABCD(2) score is likely to be most predictive. Patients
               at high risk need immediate evaluation to optimise stroke

  abstract  = "OBJECTIVES: Head trauma may cause dislodgement of otoconia and
               development of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). The
               risk of developing BPPV is expected to be highest shortly after
               the trauma, then decrease and approach the risk seen in the
               general population. The aim of this study was to estimate the
               risk-time curve of BPPV development after head trauma. STUDY
               DESIGN: Prospective observational study. METHODS: Patients with
               minimal, mild, or moderate head trauma treated at the Department
               of Neurosurgery or the Department of Orthopedic Emergency at
               Oslo University Hospital, were interviewed and examined for BPPV
               using the Dix-Hallpike and supine roll maneuvers. BPPV was
               diagnosed according to the International diagnostic criteria of
               the B{\'a}r{\'a}ny Society. Telephone interviews were conducted
               at 2, 6, and 12 weeks after the first examination. RESULTS: Out
               of 117 patients, 21\% developed traumatic BPPV within 3 months
               after the trauma. The corresponding numbers were 12\% with
               minimal trauma, 24\% with mild, and 40\% with moderate trauma.
               The difference in prevalence between the groups was significant
               (P = .018). During the first 4 weeks after the trauma, it was
               observed 20, 3, 0, and 1 BPPV onsets, respectively. No BPPV
               cases were seen for the remainder of the 3-month follow-up.
               CONCLUSION: The risk of developing BPPV after
               minimal-to-moderate head trauma is considerable and related to
               trauma severity. Most cases occur within few days after the
               trauma, but any BPPV occurring within the first 2 weeks after
               head trauma are likely due to the traumatic event. LEVEL OF
